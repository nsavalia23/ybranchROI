Description: 
This is a MATLAB GUI for segmenting Y-branch ROIs from two-photon calcium imaging .tif stacks.

Notes: 
We mocked up this GUI for segmenting dendritic y-branches in mid-2020 as a pandemic coding project. 
There is some buggyness/coding inefficiency... but it mostly works as expected and can spit out a variety of segmented masks, angles, etc. 
Perhaps it will be of use to someone, somewhere, somehow. 

Contact Neil (neil.savalia@yale.edu) for questions, concerns, or if you are interested in adapting.
